This file contains a description of the files in this directory.

chassData
Directory containing the noisy synthetic data used to produce Figure 5 of the manuscript.

chassFbaStm.mat
Contains the E. coli model Stoichiometric Matrix. Used to set up the LK-DFBA model.

chassSTM.mat
Contains the E. coli model Stoichiometric Matrix. Used to set up the LK-DFBA model.

chassV_hiRes.mat
Noiseless E. coli ODE data

driver_calculateError_chass.m

driver_genFigure5_chassError.m
MATLAB script to generate Figure 5 of the manuscript.

processedError_chass_compact.mat
File containing fitted parameters and simulation accuracy (calculated prSSE) for the unsplit and split noisy fits for Figure 5 of the manuscript.
